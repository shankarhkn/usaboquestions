    "question": "Today's corn plants evolved from an ancestral plant known as teosinte. One genetic change that  occurred in modern corn is a mutation in the regulatory DNA associated with the gene tb1. As a  result of this change, teosinte has low levels of tb1 expression, and corn has high levels of tb1  expression. High levels of tb1 expression in plant axillary buds inhibit the growth of branches,  leading to tall, unbranched corn plants in farmer's fields. In contrast, teosinte is highly branched. The  tb1 gene is also required for the development of ears of corn on the plant;  both modern corn and  teosinte produce ears of corn that carry the seeds of the plant. Based on this information, which of the following statements is NOT true?",
