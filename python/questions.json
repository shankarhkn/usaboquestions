High levels of tb1 expression in plant axillary buds inhibit the growth of branches, leading to tall, unbranched corn plants in farmer’s fields. In contrast, teosinte is highly branched.

    "question": "A microbiologist inoculates a clump of yeast cells into a large, sterile, closed flask full of growth media.  Every hour, she uses a measure of the cloudiness of the liquid (known as the optical density) to estimate the number of yeast present. Initially, the yeast in the flask doubled in number every hour. After 24 hours, however, the growth of the yeast population slowed down; after 36 hours of measurement, the population size remained steady for the next 6 hours. Which of the following is NOT true about this experiment?",

      "A": "One possible explanation for the results is the accumulation of high levels of ethanol in the flask over time.",
      "B": "For the first day, the yeast exhibit exponential growth.",
      "C": "At time = 36 hours, the yeast culture has reached a state of approximately zero population growth.",
      "D": "The plateau in population size at 36 hours is likely to be due to density-dependent regulation.",
